# sdf-matter-converter

Tool to convert between the Matter data model and the Semantic Definition Format.
The project is usable as a library or as a command line tool.

This tool is currently work in progress, hence it may or may not work in its current state.

## Prerequisites

As this software uses the `sdt::unordered_map` data type in combination with incomplete types, it has certain requirements for the compiler version.

- GCC >= 12.1
- Clang >= 15
- ESP-IDF >= 5.1

If you want to use the validation functionality, the library `libxml2` has to be installed. For Ubuntu this can be done with:

`sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev`

## Installation

Using CMake:

```
cmake
```

Documentation can be generated by using doxygen.

## Using the command line tool

Run the converter with:

```./sdf-matter-converter [flags]```

## Using the library
